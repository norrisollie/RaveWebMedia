                During my time at school I had a keen interest in ICT which led me onto completing the Web Media course at Ravensbourne. During my time i have worked on individual and collaborative projects learning new skills. I have also worked at Waitrose, which has helped me with team leadership skills, and communicating to a customer. I have thoroughly enjoyed my last 3 years at university where I have built web apps, Digital Prototypes and generated ideas through my designs for digital advertising units. I strongly believe that I have come out of university being able to code using Javascript, HTML, CSS a lot more, as well as a bit of Python. I have also developed my research skills and confidence when approaching people to test products that I have been building through my work in Waitrose and at university.
