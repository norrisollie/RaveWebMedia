            <h2 class="full-width">Bio</h2>
            
            <p>From the age of 16 my passion for the internet and digital technologies was sparked through my experience running a profitable Minecraft server for 2 years while also studying at school.</p>
 
            <p>I have since gone on to gain experience in various roles in the development process from initial concept to completion through my time studying web media at Ravensbourne University.  I am methodical and practical when working with creative processes, and able to assess the practicality of products whilst exploring their creative potential. I also have a good understanding of tools such as Photoshop and a decent understanding of both frontend and backend languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JQuery) and Swift.</p>
 
            <p>I was also involved in coordinating the Degree show for my course which involved me managing budgets, personnel, agreeing a brief with fellow students and tutors and ensuring that this was delivered. I am genial and sociable and enjoy working with others to achieve a shared goal. 
            </p>
