            <p>Since working in Shoreditch from the age of 16 whilst studying Media it opened my eyes to what it would be like to work in the Media Industry, however I felt I needed to find my niche, I chose to study Web Media because I wanted to learn a variety of new skills which includes Social Media/Community Management, Web Design and App development. I felt that it was an upcoming subject that can produce a lot of potential for employment in the future and career progression.</p>
