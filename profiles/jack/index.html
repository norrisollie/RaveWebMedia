            <p>I am passionate about design and making things not only look great but work great too. I would say my skills lie predominantly in Web/UX/UI Design. However I do enjoy having a go at coding too, getting a great buzz from creating websites for clients and making them happy with the work I produce. I am all about learning and always trying to better my knowledge and skills.</p>

                    <h1>Platinum PT</h1>

                <p> 
Platinum PT is aimed for intermediate to advanced fitness individuals or those with more disposable income. The aim is to offer a premium level of personal training to clients.</p>
 
<P>My main task for this project was to create a dynamic, custom WordPress theme which allows certain content sections to be editable by my client.</P>
 
<p>Throughout this project I also branded the business choosing the colour scheme and logo, wireframing the initial website designs and user testing as I went along.

                    <h1>Nexa</h1>

                <p> 
Nexa is a piece of Digital Marketing I created for a Squarespace theme.</p>
 
<p>Throughout this project, I had to design a theme which was aimed at designers and creatives to showcase their work and get hired.</p>
 
<p>I had to go through all the aspects and web design, understanding the market I was targeting i.e. where they live, the type of information they consume, where they travel to and from etc.
