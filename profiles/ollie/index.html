            <h2 class="full-width">Bio</h2>
            
            <p>I've been interested in writing code for website from the age of 11 or 12, when I first started to create my own websites using a service called Piczo, which was a 'drag and drop' build you own website service, and this was my first foray in to the world of development.</p>

<p>Throughout my teens, I experimented and played with code to create small websites using HTML, CSS and jQuery. I have taught myself all I know today. I'm always happy to experiment and try new things, working with new technologies, even if it doesn't always work.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2016, I moved to the Netherlands for three months to work as a front end developer intern, where I was able to learn how to write code in a professional environment, whilst I was there I began to learn Vanilla JavaScript, by the time I had finished I felt confident about writing websites with JavaScript instead of jQuery.</p>
