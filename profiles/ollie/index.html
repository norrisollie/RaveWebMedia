            <p>I've been interested in writing code for website from the age of 11 or 12, when I first started to create my own websites using a service called Piczo, which was a 'drag and drop' build you own website service, and this was my first foray in to the world of development.</p>

<p>Throughout my teens, I experimented and played with code to create small websites using HTML, CSS and jQuery. I have taught myself all I know today. I'm always happy to experiment and try new things, working with new technologies, even if it doesn't always work.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2016, I moved to the Netherlands for three months to work as a front end developer intern, where I was able to learn how to write code in a professional environment, whilst I was there I began to learn Vanilla JavaScript, by the time I had finished I felt confident about writing websites with JavaScript instead of jQuery.</p>

                <p>Track is a small web application, designed to make it easier for commuters to check train times from the stations closest to them. It works by taking the user's location, finding the closest stations and then fetching the timetables for each station and presenting them to the user on one page.</p>
